The solution depends on the specific library causing the issue.  Let's assume that `react-native-barcode-scanner` is the problematic library.  

**Original Code (bug.js):**
```javascript
import { BarCodeScanner } from 'react-native-barcode-scanner';

// ... rest of the code using BarCodeScanner ...
```

**Solution (bugSolution.js):**

Instead of `react-native-barcode-scanner`, use an Expo-compatible alternative, such as  `expo-barcode-scanner`.

```javascript
import * as BarCodeScanner from 'expo-barcode-scanner';

// ... modified code using expo-barcode-scanner (will require adapting to the new API) ...
```

Remember to install the new library: `expo install expo-barcode-scanner`

If no suitable alternative exists, consider ejecting from Expo to use the native module directly.
