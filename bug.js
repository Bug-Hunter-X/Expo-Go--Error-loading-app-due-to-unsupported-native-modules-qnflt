This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test a React Native application that uses a library that requires native modules. The error message might be unclear, but it essentially boils down to the Expo Go app being unable to load the required native modules because it doesn't support them.  This frequently happens with libraries that integrate with device hardware or use platform-specific APIs. For example, a library for interacting with a barcode scanner would likely trigger this.
